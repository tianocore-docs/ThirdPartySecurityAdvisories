# 7. [CVE-2022-1292 - OpenSSL](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1292)

## Published: 05/03/2022

## Description:

The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).

## Recommendation:

EDK2 never calls the c_rehash.in script in normal build process.

Until further notice, the following versions of OpenSSL are appropriate to use within the EDK2 CryptoPkg:

- OpenSSL 1.1.1j, updated in the edk2-stable202105 stable tag
- OpenSSL 1.1.1n, updated in the edk2-stable202205 stable tag
