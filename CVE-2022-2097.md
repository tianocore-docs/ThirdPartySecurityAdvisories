# 9. [CVE-2022-2097 - OpenSSL](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-2097)

## Published: 07/05/2022

## Description:

AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data under some circumstances. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was preexisting in the memory that wasn't written. In the special case of "in place" encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed. Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.5 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.4). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1q (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1p).

## Recommendation:

EDK2 does not enable AES OCB mode or use the 32-bit AES-NI assembly optimizations.

Until further notice, the following versions of OpenSSL are appropriate to use within the EDK2 CryptoPkg:

- OpenSSL 1.1.1j, updated in the edk2-stable202105 stable tag
- OpenSSL 1.1.1n, updated in the edk2-stable202205 stable tag
